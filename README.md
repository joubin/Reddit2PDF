#[Lets get some reading material for the flight](/post.php?post=OffLineReader.md)

I got married last weekend and this weekend I'm going to be on a 6 hour flight to Kauai, Hawaii üå¥üå¥üå¥

As much as I love my iPad, nothing can replace writing on the margins of white paper. My first plan was to write a crawler to get white papers off of university pages that I'd like to apply to for my graduate work. But given that I just got married, I found it to be in poor taste to spend a bunch of time programming. But I still needed reading material for the flight (no wifi) so I decided to write a small script to generate pdfs for me. 


Thanks to [/r/netsec](https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec) and [/r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming) for their amazing posts.

The code base is entirely in python. I wrote and executed this on both my Mac and Ubuntu server. The install script will install most of the required tools with the exception of [wkhtmltopdf](http://wkhtmltopdf.org/) which needs to be installed manually.

The main method simply get the top `N` posts from a selected sub and generates a pdf from it. 

Let me know what you think!
